LICENSE: Same as Ruby

This is a way to build ruby as a static library for inclusion in an iOS application.

Inside the ruby folder are directions to build a static library for the following ruby versions:
  * 1.8.7 p72
  * 1.9.3 p125
  
Instructions for building a static library for each version are in their respective folders.

It is assumed that this will be done on a Mac, running OS X Lion, with Xcode Version 4.3.2 and the command line tools installed.
